# List of baremetal server nodes that can be used for the deploying roles
# Each list item contains:
#    name: logical name to assign this resource
#    pm_addr: IP address for resourceIPMI interface
#    pm_type: Ironic driver to interface with this resource (typically ipmi)
#    pm_user: IPMI user account
#    pm_password: IPMI account user password
#    capabilities: String of comma separated list of node capabilities.
#                  Capabilities 'profile' and 'boot_option' are managed
#                  by Contrail Cloud and will be omitted.
